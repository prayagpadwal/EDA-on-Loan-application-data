# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Loan Application Data 📊

## 🌟 Introduction
In this project, we dive deep into a dataset loaded with various attributes related to loan applications. Our primary focus is on the `TARGET` variable, which presumably serves as an indicator of whether an applicant defaulted on a loan (1) or not (0). 🎯

## 🛠 Tasks Performed:

### 📚 Data Loading and Overview 
Loaded the dataset into a Python environment and kicked off with some initial exploration to understand the data types, number of columns, and general characteristics of the dataset. 🗂️

### ❓ Handling Missing Values 
- 🔎 Identified which columns have missing values and how many are missing.
- 🤔 Explored how missing values could potentially relate to the default rate.

### 📈 Descriptive Statistics 
- 📋 Calculated summary statistics for key continuous variables like `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` and `AMT_CREDIT`.
- 📊 Examined the distribution of the `TARGET` variable to understand the class imbalance in the dataset.

### 📊 Categorical Variable Analysis 
- 👥 Explored variables like `CODE_GENDER` and `NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE` and their relation to the default rate.

### 🤝 Correlation Analysis 
- 🧩 Investigated the correlation metrics between various `FLAG_DOCUMENT_XX` columns and the default rate.

### ⚠️ Outliers Detection 
- 🔍 Detected outliers in continuous variables (`AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`, `AMT_CREDIT`) using both visualization and statistical methods.
- 📉 Explored the impact of these outliers on the default rate.

### 🎨 Visualization 
- 📊 Utilized bar plots, histograms, and other visual tools to effectively visualize the distribution of various features and their relationship with the default rate.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- 🐍 Python
- 🐼 Pandas for data manipulation
- 📊 Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## 🎯 Conclusion:
Our EDA journey offered invaluable insights into the dataset, revealing intriguing relationships between different features and the default rate. These insights are pivotal for any subsequent predictive modeling and for making data-driven decisions in the loan approval process. 📈🎉
